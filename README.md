* **🗂️ Workspaces**
Organize your projects, research, and personal notes with the new **Workspaces** feature. Keep your context clean and switch between different setups seamlessly.

Go beyond simple notes with our new **Insights** feature. Synthesize information, discover connections, and gain a deeper understanding of your knowledge base.

* **🔍 Advanced Multi-Dimensional Queries**
Converse with your notes! You can now perform complex queries based on various dimensions like time, tasks, and other metadata. Finding the exact piece of information has never been easier.
